        <h3 className="Fatherof">Father of Divine Care Resident</h3>
        <h6>
          My son Jared has been a resident in the Divine Care residence in
          Burnsville for almost three years. Jared, his mother and I are
          extremely happy and pleased with the care he has received since the
          day he moved in. The Divine Care staff have been caring, attentive to
          his needs and wishes and are positive and timely in their actions and
          communications with Jared and with us. Jared has been in group homes
          for over twenty years. Prior to moving into this group home, Jared had
          been in two different group home settings. This is the best setting
          Jared has been in.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Jared is a bright man, who needs help accessing his environment and
          daily needs. Jared needs twenty four hour supervision, has
          ophisticated medical equipment, uses a power wheelchair, and has
          medical conditions that need to be monitored. The Divine Care staff
          have done a great job helping Jared to safely and consistently access
          his environment and keep his technology working.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          I highly recommend Divine Care as a provider. They have great staff
          members, well defined leadership positions at the house level and an
          open and professional administrative staff.

          I was introduced to Divine Care about 3 years ago. I immediately
          noticed the Genuine Sincerity of Fentu Zewdie and Staff in their
          concern for wellbeing of her clients.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Its been a great experience ever since. I am impressed by the
          professional staff and support provided, and by the strong "can do"
          spirit -no matter the task. Divine Care develops person centered
          quality living experiences for individual with disabilities. All
          patients are treated with respect and dignity.
